<h2>Selecting a 3D printer, importing a file, and slicing it.</h2>
    <p>
    To slice a 3D model for printing, you import either an STL or an OBJ file into a slicer (common ones are Cura and Prusa Slicer). Then you select the printer you are using. Then you hit the slice button. Once sliced, you transfer the GCode file to an SD card of a thumb drive, depending on the printer (Most common ones use mini SD cards).
