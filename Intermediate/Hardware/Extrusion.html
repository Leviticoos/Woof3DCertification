 Over-Extrusion: Understanding when a print is being over-extruded is an important skill. It requires a good understanding of the printer’s settings and the filament used.  Over-extruding is when the printer extrudes too much material. Some issues over extruding can cause stringing, blobs on the print, jams, and dimensional inaccuracy. Avoiding over-extrusion is the best solution, and some of those are decreasing print temperature and checking filament diameter and flow rate settings. Checking your filament settings, print temperature, and flow rate settings can help ensure over-extrusion won’t stop you in your tracks from making high-quality prints.

    </p><p>
Under-Extrusion: This common problem occurs when too little filament is extruded during the print causing gaps, missing layers, dots or holes to appear on the print. Some ways to resolve this issue include checking the extruder/hot end(gear moving freely and no clogs), adjusting the flow rate, and increasing the print temperature. This can often resolve under extrusion and improve the quality of the prints.

        This print is a great example of a over-extruding, as you can see it causes the quality of the print to decrease. Source,<a href="https://i.all3dp.com/workers/images/fit=cover,w=1000,gravity=0.5x0.5,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/06144732/Temp-tower.jpg"> all3dp.com</a>.

        A clogged hot end is can be a common issue to casue unders-extrusion. Making sure its gears are freely moving resolves this issue.
