<h2>What is a Beginner?</h2>
    <p>
    A Beginner in 3D printing is someone who won't be completely flabbergasted when asked to print an object on a well maintained printer. They should be able to take an STL, or maybe a CAD part; put it into a slicer and generate .gcode using default settings; transfer the file to a printr; and press run. They should be able to tell when a print goes wrong and cancel it as well. Essentially, they should be able to assist in printing, and do basic, menial printing tasks.

    <p>
        A beginner is not expected to know much in terms of repairs and troublesheeting. That is left to intermediate and advanced levels.
