<h2>What defines 'Advanced' 3D printing?</h2>
    <p>
        Advanced 3D printers can run the show. Upgrades, difficult troubleshooting, and custom solutions are part of this level of knowledge. While they might not be able to build a printer from scratch, they understand the parts of a printer, what they do, how they can go wrong, and how to fix them. They are expected to be able to learn a new printer quickly and apply the knowledge theyâ€™ve learned from other printers.
