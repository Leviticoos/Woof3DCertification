<p>
    One of the main reasons contemporary 3D printing certification programs have failed to take off was that they did not cover topics employers cared about and failed to ensure any form of situational competency for the people they certified. As members of WOOF3D, we wanted to create our program to educate members of our club on important topics and provide resources so they could continue to develop their skills. We aimed to solve the first issue by collecting resources from both around the web and internal members. Then, we collected industry professionals' and campus faculty's feedback on the topics we covered. This creates a resource that covers topics both employers and students care about. This will become a living resource for students to learn about topics and get directions for further learning while also being a starting point for further certification development.
</p><br><br>

<p>We decided to break the topics down into three main sections:</p>

<dt><a href=Beginner/Beginner.html>Beginner</a></dt>
<dt><a href=Intermediate/Intermediate.html>Intermediate</a></dt>

<dt><a href=Advanced/Advanced.html>Advanced</a></dt>
