    <p>
        Overhangs happen when a layer extends over the previous layer and thus is unsupported. 
    </p><p>
        There are a few different ways to deal with these overhangs. One can set up supports, so the printer makes a bunch of scaffolding to hold it up while printing, to be removed when youâ€™re finished. Another solution is to print slowly, lower the print temp, and turn on the fan at the nozzle. This will help the plastic to cool faster, so hopefully, you avoid drooping. And, of course, the best way to avoid overhang problems is to design a part without overhangs.

        A great show of how overhangs get progressivly more dificult to print. Note that even as an overhang might not make a print fail, it may produce less than perfect prints. Source,<a href="https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printing-overhang-how-to-master-overhangs-exceeding-45/"> all3dp.com</a>.
