    <p>
While 3D printing, different situations, and issues could happen that lead to a print having missing layers. This negatively affects the quality of your prints, causing unsuccessful prints. Compared to identifying this issue as a beginner, for intermediate it requires understanding the printer’s mechanics, 3D printing principles, and a solid grasp of the hardware. Some common issues that could occur are:

    </p><p>
Temperature issues (incorrect temp settings cause filament not to melt properly): Some materials have different properties, so you have to adjust your printer settings to get the best quality and successful prints. For example, if the temperature is too low, the filament may not melt sufficiently to flow properly out of the extruder leading to missing layers.
    </p><p> 
Mechanical issues (worn out belts or pulleys): The belts and pulleys are one of the main components of the printer that cause parts to be motioned. Having worn-out belts or pulleys will cause a misalignment or become inconsistent during a print leading to missing layers. For example, if the belt becomes too loose or worn out, some parts of the printer may move too fast, causing many parts to be unsynchronized and inconsistent when extruding filament.
    </p><p>
Extruder issues (clogged or worn out nozzles): This may not be noticeable immediately, but it requires an understanding of how the extruder works. Typically if it were to happen, the solution would be to replace the worn-out nozzles or clean the clogged extruder gears.

 Understanding the printer’s mechanics and settings could resolve these issues. This type of issue isn’t always noticeable at first, but developing your skills over time could help easily troubleshoot issues without difficulty.
