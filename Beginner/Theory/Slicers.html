        On the road from model to print, the slicer plays an important role. In software, you’ve no doubt learned about how to use a slicer, such as Cura or PrussiaSlicer. But what is it doing? What do the settings mean? What sits within this black box of open source code?
    </p><p>
        A slicer's job is, at its core, simple. It takes the STL list of triangles, intersects these triangles with a flat plane, and builds a 2D slice of the 3D model to print on top of other slices. But a good slicer will do more than this, it’ll make the outer walls a specific thickness, it will fill a model with a desired infill and density. It can change how tall each slice is, and change depending on how big a nozzle is. 
    </p><p>
        Taking all this into account, the slicer spits out a GCODE file, or a list of commands for the printer to follow.
