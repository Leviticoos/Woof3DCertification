        Holes are a complex thing in 3D printing. Geometrically speaking, they have every angle of overhang. As a manufacturing technique, it is best to start thinking of a 3D-printed part as an approximation of the original design, not a replica. As such, we have some shapes that are easier to print than a hole and are somewhat good approximations of circles. Depending on your post-processing, you might even just drill out the hole afterward!

        One common way is to make a triangle inscribed in the top half of the hole, such that you only ever have a 45deg overhang, and print such that that is acceptable. This will give you a hole that needs drilling but will end up round. You can also use this next shape to get a hole that needs no post work but won't be perfectly round. It will still fully constrain a shaft.
