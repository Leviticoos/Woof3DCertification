	Besides being able to start a print, you must also be able to remove the print from the printer itself. The skill of removing prints is something that can be learned and improved over time which could lead to better-quality products. Careful attention to detail and proper tools is important to removing 3d prints. When not properly doing so, accidents such as damaging the final product or even the printer could occur. Removing prints properly can help preserve the print bed and prevent any damage from happening. Not doing so can cause damage to the build surface, reducing the adhesion of future prints. 
    </p><p>
	Proper adhesion must also be considered when removing 3d print because it affects the integrity of the final product and the print bed. Poor adhesion and improper first layers can cause a print to detach from the print bed, leading to a distorted or failed print. Identifying these issues and removing the print efficiently can help reduce waste and save filament.
    </p><p> 
	One common way to safely remove a 3d print is to apply some pressure/force. If the print isn’t coming off the print bed, one method uses a careful amount of force. Use one hand to keep the print bed in place while the other pushes or pulls the print off the print bed. While doing this, it is important to be aware that most prints should come off without much force so if you are worried about breaking something, you should probably stop.
    </p><p>
	Another way is to use a tool such as a flat blade or spatula. If applying force didn’t work, try lifting the 3d print off the print bed using a flat blade or spatula. The key idea is to break the bond between the print and print bed. Although, when using this method, try not to scratch the print bed, as this might affect the adhesion. Take safety precautions; the tools you use can easily harm you or things around you. To keep you from hurting yourself, push the blade or tool away from you.
