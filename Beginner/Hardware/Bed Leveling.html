    <p>
The process of making sure the print bed of the 3d printer is level and parallel to the movement of the printer’s nozzle. A sign of an unlevel bed is that filament doesn’t stick to the print bed in certain areas and gaps between lines of filament. When leveling the bed, make sure to adjust the correct distance from the nozzle to the print bed, and one way to check is by sliding a piece of paper between the desired distance. The paper should be able to move back and forth but with some resistance without ripping. Bed leveling can be done manually by adjusting the build plate height using leveling knobs or other adjustment mechanisms.

        This is a great exmaple of how you can check if the nozzle is at a proper distance from the bed.
