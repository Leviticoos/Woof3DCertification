Making sure your 3D printer runs smoothly and efficiently involves basic maintenance tasks such as cleaning the build plate, lubricating parts, checking for broken parts, clogged nozzles, etc. To ensure the longevity of the printer and production of successful prints, printer maintenance is a key skill to master. Cleaning and making sure nothing is broken isn't as ahrd as it may seem but it will worth it to keep the printer at peak performance.
