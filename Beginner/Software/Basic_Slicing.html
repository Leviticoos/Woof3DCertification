<h2>Selecting a 3D printer, importing a file, and slicing it.</h2>
    <p>
    To slice a 3D model for printing, you import either an STL or an OBJ file into a slicer (common ones are Cura and Prusa Slicer). Then you select the printer you are using. Then you hit the slice button. Once sliced, you transfer the GCode file to an SD card of a thumb drive, depending on the printer (Most common ones use mini SD cards).

<h2>Where to find slicer settings and what they are.</h2>
<p>
    This is relatively simple. Slicer settings are methods to change how the slicer converts a model into commands to send to the printer. They are often found in a tab on the right side of the program (Cura and Prusa Slicer). There are commonly multiple preset options for print quality and speed. These are typically listed with the presetâ€™s layer height in the title. Changing these is the most basic form of adjusting the quality/speed of the 3D print.
