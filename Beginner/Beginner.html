<h2>What is a Beginner?</h2>
    <p>
        A Beginner in 3D printing won't be completely flabbergasted when asked to print an object on a well-maintained printer. They should take an STL or a CAD part; put it into a slicer, generate gcode using default settings; transfer the file to a printer; and press run. They should be able to tell when a print goes wrong and cancel it. Essentially, they should be able to assist in printing and do basic, menial printing tasks. A beginner is not expected to know much about repairs and troubleshooting. That is left to intermediate and advanced levels.
