    <p>
 Different materials sometimes require different nozzles, and switching nozzles enables users to print different kinds of materials. When installing a new nozzle, ensure it’s compatible with the printer and extruder assembly. Switching nozzles requires a good amount of knowledge of the printer's hardware and the process of changing the nozzle itself. Proper adjustment and alignment of the extruder, hotend, and new nozzle must be achieved. The distance between the nozzle and the print bed must also be adjusted accordingly. During this process, maintenance is also involved, such as cleaning the hotend of any obstructions and old filament. Although the process may not be as difficult, some safety concerns shouldn’t be overlooked as the hotend and its components can easily reach high temperatures, which could cause burns or other injuries. Taking precautions and using the correct tools are just as important.
